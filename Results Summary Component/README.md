## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Google fonts](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Hanken+Grotesk:wght@500;700;800&display=swap) - Used Google fonts(Hanken Grotesk -> 500, 700, 800)

### What I learned

1. I learned how to work from mobile first.
   I am used to creating from desktop to mobile which I realised during this project make me write more css to optimize the mobile version to be responsive, which is is to do from mobile first.
2. How to create a web-app using a pre-defined design and to follow a list of requirements.

3. How to properly plan and do a prototype (first-draft) design.

4. how to create a readme file for projects, reflect on work and note down new concepts which you descoverd while working on my project

### Continued development

I currently working on my improving

1. How to finish my projects as quickly as possible and to use less code and to write readable code.
2. My design skills.
3. Proper use of fonts to make my projects look professional.
4. Not being able to make use of `data.json` file since i am not familiar **react** yet, hope on my next frontend mentor project I will be able to use all the alocated resources.

I would like to thank frontend mentor for creating an environment were us web develops
how don't have a lot of projects for portfolio, where we can given real-life projects with real challenges and guidelines, where we can shared our projects with our developers and get a feel of how it would be working for Software Engineering would be.
This is my first challenge, of many to come.
